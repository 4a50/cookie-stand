      <h2>Meet Pat and Family</h2>
      <img src="img/family.jpg">
      <p>Pat grew up in a small town just outside of the Seattle area. He was always welcomed home for a fun day of
        fishing on the weekends with the smell of warm baked cookies. As Pat grew up he discoverd his passion for
        baking, as well as his love of catching salmon. One day at the dinner table Pat set down his fork, looked at his
        family and said, "Salmon Cookies!". The rest is history!</p>
